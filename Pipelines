You can customize the stages and steps to match your specific build, test, and deployment requirements.

*) Run Your Jenkins Pipeline

  *) This is a basic example of a Jenkins pipeline for integrating Jenkins with Git. You can
     expand and customize the pipeline to suit your specific project requirements, such as
     integrating additional tools, performing security checks, and more.



*) Pipeline for integrating maven with jenkins


pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                checkout scm
            }
        }

                    def mvnCMD = "${mvnHome}/bin/mvn"

                    // Build the project using Maven
                    sh "${mvnCMD} clean install"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

*) In this Jenkinsfile:
  We define a pipeline with two stages:
    1) Checkout 
    2) Build.
 *) In the Build stage, we configure Maven. We assume that a Maven tool named "Maven"
    is defined in the Jenkins Global Tool Configuration.
 *) The sh step executes the Maven build by invoking the mvn command.

*)  Run Your Jenkins Pipeline

    *) This pipeline sets up a basic continuous integration (CI) workflow for building 
       Java applications with Maven in Jenkins. You can expand and customize the pipeline to 
       include additional stages, testing, deployment steps, and more complex build scenarios based
       on your project's requirements.

                }
            }
        }
    }
}

  *) In this Jenkinsfile:

      *) We define a pipeline with three stages: Checkout, Provision Infrastructure,
        and Deploy Application.
      *) In the environment section, we set the ANSIBLE_HOSTS environment variable to 
          specify the path to your Ansible inventory file (e.g., inventory.ini).
      *) In the Provision Infrastructure and Deploy Application stages, we use the 
         ansible-playbook command to execute Ansible playbooks (provision.yml and deploy.yml)
         that provision infrastructure and deploy the application.

*) Run Your Jenkins Pipeline

   *) This pipeline integrates Ansible with Jenkins, allowing you to automate infrastructure provisioning
      and application deployment tasks. You can expand and customize the pipeline to include additional stages,
      testing, and other automation steps based on your project's requirements.

   *) In the Build Docker Image stage, we use the docker build command to build
      a Docker image from the project files.
   *) In the Push Docker Image stage, we use the docker push command to push the
      Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).

 *) In the Initialize Terraform stage, we use the terraform init command to
    initialize Terraform in the workspace.
 *) In the Plan Infrastructure stage, we use the terraform plan command to 
    generate an execution plan for Terraform.
 *) In the Apply Infrastructure stage, we use the terraform apply command
    to create or update the infrastructure based on the execution plan.
 *) In the Destroy Infrastructure stage, we provide an option to destroy
    the infrastructure if the previous stages were successful.
   [note]:- Be cautious when using this stage in a production environment.

                }
            }
        }
    }
}

*) In this Jenkinsfile

 *) We define a pipeline with two stages
       1) Checkout 
       2) Build and Analyze.
 *) In the Build and Analyze stage, we use the withSonarQubeEnv step to 
    set up the SonarQube environment. Replace 'SonarQube_Server_Name'
    with the name of your SonarQube server configuration in Jenkins.
 *) We build your project (in this example, a Maven project) and then
    run the SonarQube analysis with the mvn sonar:sonar command.

*) Run Your Jenkins Pipeline

   *) This pipeline integrates SonarQube with Jenkins, allowing you to perform
      automated code quality analysis on your projects as part of your CI/CD process.
      You can expand and customize the pipeline to include additional stages, testing,
      and other automation steps based on your project's requirements.

                    dashboardId: 'your-dashboard-id', // Replace with your dashboard ID
                    datasource: 'your-datasource-name', // Replace with your datasource name
                ])
            }
        }
    }
}

      *) In this simplified example, the grafanaDashboard step is used to display a Grafana dashboard 
         using the Grafana Dashboard for Blue Ocean plugin. You'll need to replace 'your-dashboard-id'
         and 'your-datasource-name' with the specific dashboard ID and datasource name you want to use.
      *) Please note that this example provides a simplified overview of integrating Grafana with Jenkins.
         The specific implementation may vary depending on your project, the Jenkins plugins and Grafana 
         configurations used, and your monitoring and visualization needs

}

In this Jenkinsfile

  *) We define a pipeline with three stages: Checkout, Provision AWS Resources,

  *) In the Provision AWS Resources stage, we use the AWS CLI to provision 
     AWS resources. You can customize this stage to create EC2 instances, manage
     RDS databases, deploy CloudFormation stacks, etc.
  *) In the Deploy Application stage, we use the AWS CLI or other AWS SDKs to deploy 
     the application to the provisioned AWS resources.

*) Run Your Jenkins Pipeline

    *) Please note that this example provides a simplified overview of integrating
      AWS with Jenkins. The specific implementation may vary depending on your project,
      the AWS services you need to interact with, and your AWS infrastructure-as-code
      (IAC) setup.
